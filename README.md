# Building a Fully Functional To-Do App in JavaScript

# Introduction

---

In this comprehensive Project, we'll build a fully functional To-Do application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app will allow users to:

- **Add new tasks**
- **Mark tasks as completed**
- **Edit existing tasks**
- **Delete tasks**
- **Persist tasks using Local Storage**

We'll focus on understanding the structure by using plain HTML in our JavaScript code and attaching event listeners individually to each element for clarity.

## Features

-  Adding Tasks
-  Displaying Tasks from Local Storage
-  Deleting Tasks
-  Editing Tasks
-  Marking Tasks as Completed

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and functionality.
- **Local Storage**: For data persistence.
